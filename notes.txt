PROS of this system:
- Easy to understand workflows
- Easy to compose new workflows

Cons of this system:
- Could be potentially confusing with both routes and workflow containing overlapping data
- route guards and mixin might be hard to understand at first glance (behind the scenes magic)
- route guards and mixin could continue to grow and become unwieldy
- 



REMAINING QUESTIONS:
- How to repeat certain workflow pieces (such as Config for multiple devices)
-- modify the steps array with new steps if devices are added? Would probably need to have the steps store a CCIN or uid of some sort

- different workflows might have different required steps... how do we work this in?
-- Have a requiredSteps override in the workflow array?? having required steps in two places might b weird
-- 

- Steps such as cart summary could have multiple different next steps, how do we account for this?
